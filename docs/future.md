# Future plans



## Change LLM Service!
- Program is using SambaNova cloud through Julian's private API key. This is a temporary solution

## Improve data sourcing from Funding&Tender Portal
- do not use weird querying anymore

## Use EU Login
- so that everyone has their own space


## Add Caches
- so that not all projects need to be downloaded every time
- so that not all projects need to be classified everytime. 


## Allow users to change workflow settings for their new topics (and also add new topics themselves)
- needs some kind of new website in addition to the dashboard


## Add more data sources
- EIB
- ESA
- Pitchbook / Crunchbase
- National initiatives
- Kohesio (EC)


## Going public

In order to make the dashboard accessible to the public the procedure is:
-	Move the server to a DIGIT instance (at the moment its on an AWS EC2 server)
-	Request public access from CNECT.D.4. They are the DG COMM SPOC (Single Point of contact). 
-	url needs to be agreed by DG COMM, CNEC.D.4 and CNECT.C.2. 
-	coordinate with  R3 to finalize the ITCB governance aspect (Govis2, etc ..)

My feedback from small test:  very good interface
the use cases I identified :    Very very promissing tool for our activities, for the 3 levels :
1.	Mainly for the early stages of Programme definition
2.	Also for compilation at MS level , for negotiations
3.	Also for pinpointing  the historical sources of funding for a beneficiary
Another item to trigger the reflexion:
+ from discussion with MassimoDR :
Use case 4) verification ex-ante (during the Evaluation of proposal)  of the cost declaration  (for specialised equipment with evaluators having low expertise or vision on that) 
                            Example :  “what is the average,  min and max cost of a Single Photon Source of type X , from all the previous proposals and projects? “
                                          Or “what is the average,  min and max cost of an Encryptor blade from Toshiba, ID Quantique , or any vendor  , from all the previous proposals and projects?
                            Could be very interesting to see what the EFMO tool replies on that
