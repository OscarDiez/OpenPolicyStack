# Data Evaluation

In ```data_evaluation.py```, each evaluation is defined by a class which inherits ```Evaluation``` and contains a method ```evaluate``` (which produces the result in numbers) and a method ```plot_result``` (which creates a plot from the result). The input data consist of the processed projects and organizations.
